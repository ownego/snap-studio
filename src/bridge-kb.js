/* bridge-kb.js — KB tab side of topology B, now a small job board: a rail
   listing existing kb/ articles (kb_list) plus a pinned "+ New job" entry
   that opens the instruction/session-tabs form. Unlike bridge-editor.js
   (which only ever ANSWERS commands the bridge sends down), this file is
   the INITIATOR: it collects an instruction (+ an optional reference .md
   and a set of session tabs), asks the service worker to relay a
   kb_start/kb_cancel/kb_query/kb_list/kb_read over the existing /ext
   WebSocket (see src/bridge-worker.js's callBridge()), and renders the
   kb_progress lines the bridge pushes back as the spawned agent works. See
   KB-BRIDGE.md mục 7 for the full design and snap-bridge/kb-job.js /
   server.js for the other end of this.

   The rail selects between three views, exactly one on screen at a time
   (showBoardView): "+ New job" — the form; the job that form spawned —
   agent canvas, article preview and progress log; and an article. Start
   switches to the job view rather than leaving the user on the form,
   because from that moment the run is the thing to watch and the form's
   own inputs are disabled anyway — and a run that finishes with an article
   hands straight over to that article's view (finishAuthorRun), because a
   finished run has nothing left to watch and the article is the result.

   Session tabs (kb-session-cmd list/add/remove) are answered locally by
   bridge-worker.js — no round trip to snap-bridge — since it's pure
   chrome.tabs bookkeeping; only kb_start's snapshot of the list travels
   over the bridge. Selecting an article in the job board is read-only for
   now (kb_save_md exists server-side but has no UI yet — that's the split
   markdown|preview editor, the next slice of Phase 3).
