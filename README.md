# Snap Studio (V1 — prototype)

A quick-capture screenshot + annotate tool for the support team. This started as one piece
of a larger idea (a Monosnap-style capture tool sharing a design system and engine with a
"Guide Studio" documentation tool) prototyped inside the **Ownego Marketing Material
Toolkit** (`github.com/pdtoan2811-bit/ownegoMarketingMaterialToolkit`) — this repo is that
one piece, `tools/snap-studio/`, lifted out to stand on its own. This is the V1 slice of
that roadmap: capture, annotate, copy/export. No Snap Library, no ticket integration, no
Component Forge yet — those were sketched as V2/V3 in the original proposal.

Forked from that toolkit's `tools/doc-guide/packages/userguidesnap`, but the editor is a
**new, smaller** implementation: one image at a time, not a multi-slide guide/job. That's a
deliberate cut, not an oversight — see "What this is NOT" below.

## Try it

1. Chrome → `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked** → select
   this repo's root folder.
2. Click the extension icon on any normal page → **Snap visible tab** (or **Snap a
   region…**, or the shortcuts `Alt+Shift+S` / `Alt+Shift+R`). A **Snap Studio** browser tab
   opens with the capture already dropped in. Snapping again — from the same page or a
   different one — never overwrites it: the new capture opens as its own tab in the strip
   above the canvas, and the old one stays right there to switch back to and copy from.
   **Snap a window/screen…** (`Ctrl+Shift+9` — a **global** shortcut, so it fires even while
   another app has focus; Chrome only allows that for `Ctrl+Shift+[0-9]` combos, see the
   comment on `captureDesktop()` in `background.js`) is the same idea for anything
   `captureVisibleTab` can't reach — another app's window, a second monitor, the whole
   desktop: it opens Chrome's own screen/window picker (via `chrome.desktopCapture`, the one
   API that can be triggered from anywhere and still land the grab in a stable tab), grabs
   one frame once you pick a source, and always opens it as its own new tab — same as a
   whole-tab or region snap, never merged into whatever's already open. There's no live
   drag-to-select for this path (a selection overlay can't be injected into another app's
   window), so the crop tool opens immediately on the full frame instead — drag it down to
   the part you want, `Enter` to apply, `Esc` to keep the whole shot.
3. Add components from the left rail, drag them into place, edit text/options on the
   right. Toggle **Context stamp** in the topbar on/off.
4. **⧉ Copy image** — or just `Ctrl+C` with the stage focused — to paste straight into a
   ticket, or **⬇ Export PNG** to save a file. **⧉ Copy context** copies the
   browser/OS/URL/time as plain text, independent of the visual stamp.
5. `Ctrl+V` pastes whatever image is on your clipboard — a Snipping Tool grab, a
   screenshot a customer sent you, an image copied out of any other app. On an empty
   stage the first paste becomes the shot; after that each paste **adds an image layer**
   you can drag, resize (aspect always locked) and stack — two shots in one frame for a
   before/after, or a zoomed detail beside the whole page. Nothing is ever replaced by a
   paste; **Replace base image…** in the base layer's panel is the deliberate start-over.
6. **Layers** in the left rail lists everything in paint order, starting with the shot
   itself (**Base image** — selectable, not deletable, since it sets the exported frame).
   Pasted images always sit below the annotations so a new one can't bury a text-box or
   highlight you already placed.
7. The tab strip above the canvas holds every capture you've snapped, uploaded, or reopened
   from the Library this session — click one to switch to it (to copy an image or a layer
   across), or **✕** on it to close it. Closing a tab, **Replace base image…** in the base
   layer's panel, and applying a crop all discard a capture (or its pre-crop pixels) for
   good — on direct instruction none of them save to the Library for you; each one confirms
   first (crop doesn't, since it never drops an annotation) rather than pretending there's a
   safety net. **⤓ Save to library** in the toolbar is the only thing that ever writes there —
   click it before you close/replace/crop if you want the capture to survive that. Click a
   card in the Library to reopen it as a new tab with every annotation intact. Saved snaps
   auto-expire (14 days by default — change it, or turn it off, in the tab's Retention
   setting) and never leave this browser profile.
8. The **Components** tab (topbar) is the kit itself: every component on a light ground, a
   dark ground, or your live capture — and **+ New component** to author a new one.
   Anything you make there shows up in the Snap rail under **Yours**.

## The KB tab needs one more setup pass

Everything above works from **Load unpacked** alone. The **KB** tab does not: it is served by
`snap-bridge`, a separate node process, and reaching it takes a `npm install`, a native
messaging host so the tab's **▶ Start bridge** button can launch that process, and a reload.

[KB-SETUP.md](KB-SETUP.md) walks through it — written so you can hand it to Claude Code in
this repo ("read `KB-SETUP.md` and set up the KB tab on this machine") and let it do the
parts that aren't `chrome://extensions` clicks. [KB-BRIDGE.md](KB-BRIDGE.md) is the design
behind it, which you don't need in order to set it up.

## How export actually works (read this before debugging a blank/cut-off PNG)

`chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab` is doing the real work, not a canvas redraw. That's not
incidental — the glass `backdrop-filter` on `.cmp-zoom-magnify` etc. does **not** rasterize
through a DOM-to-canvas library (html2canvas and friends reconstruct the page rather than
screenshot it, and backdrop-filter has nothing to do that reconstruction with). doc-guide's
`render.mjs` gets a real screenshot from headless Playwright; this extension has no Node
process behind it, so `editor.js` asks the background service worker to screenshot **this
same tab** with the toolbar/panels hidden (`body.render`), then crops the result down to
the stage. Same principle, different browser process taking the picture.

The one real limitation this creates: **`captureVisibleTab` can only capture what's
actually painted in the current browser window.** If your screenshot is bigger than the
window you're exporting from, the export is cropped to whatever fits, with a toast telling
you so — maximize the window and export again. There is no scale-to-fit fallback in V1;
an earlier version of this file scaled the stage down before capturing, but that reintroduces
a CSS trap (an active `transform` on an ancestor changes the containing block for
`position:fixed` descendants, which the render-mode CSS relies on) — simpler to just crop
honestly than to fight that.

## What this is NOT (yet)

- **No server, no cross-device history, no automatic saving.** The **Library** tab (V2's
  "Snap Library") only ever gets written to by the user clicking **⤓ Save to library** — on
  direct instruction, closing a tab, **Replace base image…**, and cropping do NOT save there
  for you; the first two confirm before discarding instead. It's `chrome.storage`'s cousin,
  not a server: history lives in this one browser profile only, auto-expires (14/7/30 days,
  or never, set in the Library tab), and there is no share link and no sync between machines.
  See `src/library.js` and `ROADMAP.md`'s V2 section.
- **No connector wiring.** The kit's `__connector` parts — text-box's and
  zoom-magnify's optional relocate-with-a-line-back mode, and the arrow's own
  anchor-dot convention they both cite — exist in `tokens.css` but nothing in
  `editor.js` drags one out or recomputes it as its anchor moves. In place (the
  kit's own default anatomy) works fully; only the relocate exception is missing.
  Revisit if support agents actually need to detach an annotation from its target.
- **No inline text editing on the canvas.** Text-box/label text is edited in the Properties
  panel, not by clicking into the component directly — the original editor's contenteditable
  approach needs care to avoid losing cursor position on re-render, and V1 sidesteps it by
  never re-rendering the DOM node a textarea is bound to (see `syncNode()` vs `render()`
  in `src/surface.js` — that split is deliberate, not a missing feature).
- **No ticket/Slack integration.** V2 in the proposal.
- **Component Forge, but only the local slice.** The **Components** tab previews all eight
  kit components on a light ground, a dark ground, or the live capture, and lets you author
  new ones (pick a base, edit the CSS, live preview, drop them on the shot like any kit
  component). What it does NOT have is the governance half of the V3 proposal: no branch,
  no PR, no `catalog.json` duplicate check, no permission gate. Components authored there
  live in `chrome.storage` for one browser profile until someone pastes the CSS into
  `tokens.css` — which forks this repo's vendored copy of the kit rather than syncing it.
- **Exercised for real, but not yet by a human on the golden path above.** The Components
  tab and the custom-component round-trip were exercised in Chrome over `file://`, so the
  glass, the grounds, the lint and the lab→stage handoff are known to render. Separately,
  the `snap-bridge` KB pipeline has been driving the loaded extension for real since the
  2026-08-27 trial recorded in [KB-BRIDGE.md](KB-BRIDGE.md): `captureVisibleTab`, the
  editor's screenshot-based export, and all eight annotation components have real exported
  PNGs to show for it. What that trial doesn't cover — the region drag-select UI, the
  desktop/window picker (`Ctrl+Shift+9`), the popup, and the Library tab — is still only
  read back, not run. Load it unpacked and walk the golden path above before trusting those
  specific paths with a real ticket.

## Design-system wiring (and why this repo is standalone)

`src/tokens.css` is a **generated, vendored bundle** of three CSS layers from the
**OneShot Guideline Kit** in `github.com/cedrus-8864/oeditions-tung`
(`tools/design-kit/css/{foundations,presentation,annotation-kit}.css`), themed by that
repo's `editorial-glass` brand pack. `src/kit-catalog.js` mirrors the same repo's
`tools/design-kit/catalog.json` — the Components tab reads its `name`, `summary`,
`use_when` and `gotchas` straight off it, so the panel documents whatever the kit
actually says today rather than a blurb someone hand-copied once.

Everything Snap Studio owns is below the `EXTRAS` banner at the bottom of `tokens.css`:
the app-shell aliases (`--surface`, `--ink`, `--accent`… resolving onto the kit's
`--color-*` tokens), the editor-only affordances (selection outline, resize handle,
arrow endpoint grips — all stripped by `body.render`), and one real component,
`.cmp-label`, which the kit deliberately does not have. `src/editor.css` is likewise
this tool's own, and safe to edit directly.

Everything **above** that banner is upstream's. This repo has no sync command, so
re-vendoring is manual: re-concatenate the three layers and paste the `EXTRAS` block
back on the end. An edit made above the banner is lost the next time anyone does that.

> **The previous kit is gone.** Until this swap, `tokens.css` carried a completely
> different design system that was *also* called "editorial-glass" — purple `#7c2cfb`
> liquid glass, `.cmp-badge` / `.cmp-callout` / `.cmp-pill` / `.cmp-mag` /

### What changed in the swap

| was | is now | note |
|---|---|---|
| `.cmp-badge` | `.cmp-step-marker` | labelled `Step {n}`, never a bare numeral; `--compact` / `--video` |
| `.cmp-callout` | `.cmp-text-box` | opaque white card, `mode: step \| note`, composed step badge |
| `.cmp-highlight` | `.cmp-highlight-box` | `--shaded` variant; bordered is the default |
| `.cmp-blur` | `.cmp-privacy-blur` | carries a 92% neutral-300 fill over the blur (upstream deviation, documented) |
| `.cmp-mag` | `.cmp-zoom-magnify` | rounded rectangle, never a circle — the circle is the pattern it replaces |
| `.cmp-arrow` | `.cmp-arrow` | same name, new internals: straight/curved/elbow, real stroke-behind-stroke outline, anchor dot |
| `.cmp-connector` | — | dropped; the anchor-dot convention now lives on the arrow, and text-box / zoom-magnify carry their own `__connector` parts |
| `.cmp-pill` | `.cmp-label` | not a kit component any more — Snap Studio's own, in `EXTRAS`, because the context stamp needs a chip and the kit has no small-label primitive |
| — | `.cmp-spotlight-cutout` | **new**: dims the whole frame, leaves one region lit |
| — | `.cmp-screenshot-canvas` | **new**: the padded ground + rounded frame, on by default via the **Image frame** toggle |

## Not yet wired up

- **No Hub / toolkit integration.** As a standalone repo this doesn't register with
  anything — the toolkit's Hub assumes every tool has a `studio` npm script on a port, and
  V1 has no server (just a packed extension + a static editor page) to register anyway.
- **Fonts load from Google Fonts CDN** in `editor.html` — a packed MV3 extension's default
  CSP blocks remote fonts, so this only works unpacked/dev. Self-host before shipping.
