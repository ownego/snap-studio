/* kb-pipeline.test.mjs — the authoring pipeline's SEQUENCING: which stage runs
   in which round, and what a pause landing inside one leaves behind for the
   resume to pick up.

   Worth a test because every failure mode here is expensive and silent. A
   phase that advances one too far skips a stage — the article ships with the
   prose of a screenshot that was re-shot after it was written. A phase that
   does not advance re-runs one — a whole browser session spent shooting
   screens that already existed. Neither throws, and both cost minutes of real
   agent time to discover by hand.

   driveAuthorPipeline calls its three stages through STAGE_RUNNERS for exactly
   this reason (see its own note); the stubs below record the calls instead of
   spawning agent sessions.
