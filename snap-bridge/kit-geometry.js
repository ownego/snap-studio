/* kit-geometry.js — where an annotation goes, and whether it went somewhere sane.

   Two jobs, both previously spread through server.js and both previously wrong
   in the same way:

   1. Turning a real element's on-screen box into props for a given component.
      x/y does not mean the same thing for every type — step, label and zoom
      render through translate(-50%,-50%) so theirs is a CENTRE, highlight,
      blur, spotlight and textbox use a plain left/top so theirs is a CORNER —
      and the old geometryFor() treated step and label as corners. A 90px pill
      placed as if x/y were its corner lands half a pill-width off target, on
      the control it is supposed to be numbering, every single time.

   2. Checking that the result is not off the frame, not sitting on the thing it
      points at, and not carrying prop names no component reads. None of that
      was checked anywhere; see checkGeometry() for what shipped as a result.

   Split out of server.js so both are testable without standing up an HTTP
   server and a WebSocket, and so the anchor question has exactly one answer in
   this codebase — read back from each component's own style() by
   kit-introspect, never restated by hand.

   Coordinates here are always CAPTURE PIXELS: the pixel grid of the PNG on
   disk, origin at its top-left. Not CSS pixels, not viewport pixels. */

 *  corner-anchored while rendering through translate(-50%,-50%).

   Geometry check — the thing that was missing entirely.

   Until now the only validation on an annotation was assertElShapes(): props
   nested under "props", nothing more. Everything the placement playbook calls a
   hard rule — nothing runs off the frame, a callout never covers its own target,
   an arrow never ends in dead space — was enforced by asking the agent to look
   at the PNG afterwards and be honest about it. Shipped articles show how well
   that works: a highlight box whose bottom edge is 7px from the image edge and
   frames a section the viewport already cut in half, an arrowhead sitting on the
   radio button it points at, and `"variant": "bordered"` on six elements — a
   prop no component has ever read.

   These are warnings, not refusals, on purpose. The renderer can draw all of it,
   and a human editing job.json by hand in KB Studio may be mid-thought. What
   they cannot be is silent.
