/* kb-job.js — spawns a Claude Agent SDK session that reads a user
   instruction (with an optional reference .md attached), drives the
   browser through this process's own mcp__snap__* tools ONLY, and writes
   the final KB article via snap_write_kb or snap_render_job. This is
   topology B: the spawned session is just a second MCP client hitting the
   same /mcp endpoint topology A already proved works — see KB-BRIDGE.md
   mục 7 for the original design writeup.

   The job works DIRECTLY on the tabs the user put in its session, by their
   real tabId, from its very first tool call — no throwaway tab, no tab
   group, no adoption. That used to require earning: Chrome Bridge refused
   any tab outside the group it handed the session, so the job navigated a
   throwaway tab first (to materialise that group), then had snap-bridge
   call the extension's adopt_tabs to move the session's tabs into it. That
   whole dance existed to work around Chrome Bridge's own scoping — the
   mcp__snap__* tools it works around are NOT scoped by any tab group (they
   call chrome.tabs.* directly), so once Chrome Bridge was dropped from this
   stage the dance had nothing left to do. See KB-BRIDGE.md's "Khép lại câu
   chuyện tab group" section for the full history and the reasoning.

   The real tradeoff from dropping it: this job has NO way to open a new
   browser tab any more. If a session tab is closed or otherwise unusable,
   there is no throwaway-tab fallback to fall back to — the job stops and
   reports which tab needs to be reopened and re-added, same as it already
   does when a task needs an origin outside its session. Navigation
   (snap_navigate) is still scoped to the origin(s) of the tab(s) the user
   added — see canUseTool below.

   One job at a time (module-level state, not a Map) — starting a second
   job while one runs is rejected outright, not queued.

   An AUTHORING job is three agent sessions in sequence, not one (see
   runAuthorPipeline): capture (drives the browser, produces the images and the
   annotations on them) -> write (no browser, writes the prose from those images)
   -> review (no browser, fixes NOTHING, files findings). Findings carry an
   owner, and each of the first two stages is resumed with its own findings for
   up to MAX_FIX_ROUNDS passes. The split is not for parallelism — nothing here
   runs concurrently and it must not: the Snap Studio editor that snap_open/
   snap_add/snap_export drive is a singleton (server.js's lastOpened mirrors one
   open capture) and job.json is written whole, so two agents working at once
   would overwrite each other's annotations. It is for CONTEXT: the agent that
   spent forty tool calls driving Chrome is the worst-placed one to judge
   whether the exported PNG reads well, because its context is full of what it
   MEANT to draw. A stage that has only the PNGs and the playbook sees the
   pixels instead. */

   these steps — so that scanning the log answers "where is it up to" without
   knowing the tool surface.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   Revise mode — the prompt box in KB Studio's article panel. The user types
   at an article that already EXISTS instead of asking for a new one, so this
   is deliberately a SMALLER job than authoring rather than the same one with
   a different prompt:

     - no browser at all. The chrome MCP server is not attached and every
       non-snap tool is denied, so a job started from a text box can never
       navigate the user's logged-in session or click around the live app.
       That also means it needs no session tabs and no Chrome Bridge, and it
       runs when the browser side is not set up at all.
     - success is not "wrote an article". A revise job that reads the pins and
       answers "step 3's target was never in frame, re-shoot it" did exactly
       its job while writing nothing — so no required-output tool.

   What it CAN do is the whole fix loop, all of it off files already on disk:
   snap_comments -> snap_job -> snap_render_job (or snap_open/snap_add/
   snap_export for an article with no job.json) -> snap_view ->
   snap_comment_resolve -> snap_learn.
