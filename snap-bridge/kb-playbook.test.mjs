/* kb-playbook.test.mjs — the LEARNINGS log is written by a model, in a file a
   human also edits by hand, and read back into every KB job's system prompt.
   Its failure modes are all silent: a bullet the regex misses folds into the
   one above it, a retired learning that still gets loaded keeps being taught,
   and an id that shifts breaks a `supersedes` that was correct when written.
   None of that throws, so it gets a test.
