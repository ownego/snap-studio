/* kb-playbook.js — the LEARNINGS log at the bottom of
   .claude/skills/kb/PLACEMENT_PLAYBOOK.md: how a learning gets an id, where a
   new one is inserted, how a wrong one is retired, and what a job's system
   prompt actually sees.

   Why a module and not four lines inside snap_learn: two sides need the same
   understanding of the file. server.js WRITES it (snap_learn), kb-job.js READS
   it into every stage's system prompt, and the entire value of `supersedes` is
   that those two agree on which bullets are still live. The same regex written
   out twice drifts on the first format change, and the failure is silent — a
   retired learning quietly keeps being taught.

   The rule the format encodes: the log is append-only for HISTORY — nothing is
   deleted, and a retired bullet keeps its text so the next reader can see how
   it was wrong — but it is NOT append-only for AUTHORITY. Three of the first
   sixteen learnings turned out to be wrong, two of them by inferring an
   "engine limitation" from one or two guesses at a prop name, which is exactly
   what PRINCIPLE #3 warns about. Until this existed, the only way to stop those
   being fed to every future job was for a human to hand-edit the file, so they
   sat in the system prompt for weeks. Now the session that disproves one
   retires it in the same call that records what is true instead. */
